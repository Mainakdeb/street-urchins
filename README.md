## Extracting Metadata from 3D Sea Urchin Trabecular Bone Structure

### Steps Involved:
![](/images_and_gifs/horizontal_skeletonization_steps.png)
1. Blur raw data to smooth out high freuency noise -> leads to better thresholding results
2. Threshold image to convert grayscale image(s) into binary format in relation to the threshold value.
3. Skeletonize image (using Lee94 algorithm):
4. Distance Transform (2D or 3D) - labels each pixel/voxel of the image with the distance to the nearest background/void.
5. Extract Nodes and Branches
6. Export data as CSVs

### Skeletonize 3D Data:
This skeleton data would later be used to run mechanical simulations.

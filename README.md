### Current issue:
curvature heatmap bad, possible bug in perimeter coordinate list

* number of junctions and lengths of lines in skeleton - do dis dont slack
  * https://jni.github.io/skan/index.html Try this library for skeleton analysis
  * [3d volume plots blog post](https://blog.jupyter.org/ipygany-jupyter-into-the-third-dimension-29a97597fc33) -> https://k3d-jupyter.org/
* Lee94 skeletonization in 3D? Revsit if needed after discussion (used medial axis thinning)
* 3d model converted into mesh
* finite element analysis
* porousity? accross z axis
* porousity influence mechanical behaviour
* pore space in 3d
* isosurface in python?
* seg 3d accepts tif file

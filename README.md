### Current issue:
* use seg3d segmentation only
* Plot voxels in 3d instead of mesh?
* modularize everything
* qualtify difference between valentinas segmentation data and mine

### Misc:
* https://jni.github.io/skan/index.html 
* [3d volume plots blog post](https://blog.jupyter.org/ipygany-jupyter-into-the-third-dimension-29a97597fc33) -> https://k3d-jupyter.org/
* finite element analysis
* porousity? accross z axis
* pore space in 3d
* isosurface in python?
